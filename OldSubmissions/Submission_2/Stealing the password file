Stealing the password file:

I started by directly putting "https://localhost:8000/passwd.json" into the search bar and got the input of the passwd file.
Something like "https://localhost:8000/..%c0%af" didnt work because an uri malformed error was thrown.

All unknown files etc. are handled by my "staticserverrHandler". There I use the URL functionalities which dont accept the encoded or double encoded versions of ".." etc.
As the main protection i added a function which checks the allowed files and its endings. If its not an allowed fileending i just send back an 404 error.

I tried also "https://localhost:8000/passwd.json%00.js" to trick the filesystem into thinking its an allowed fileending but this lead to no success.

I made an extra function and encrypted the pw with pbkdf2Sync and the salt with randombytes(16) from the crypto functions. I saved the encrypted pw, salt and iterations (100.000) in my passwordfile.

Temporarily i had a problem that my css etc. files werent loaded, probably because of some problems with the scope. I fixed it by saving the needed variable specifically.
