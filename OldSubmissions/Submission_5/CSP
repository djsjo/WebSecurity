CSP:


For "My first web application" I called the url "http://localhost:8000/information?q=<script>alert('test');</script>" and the browser showed me the alert as expected.
Because its a very Basic Website which is doing nothing besided getting css and js from origin and showing the parameter etc I added the following CSP:

res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'none'; script-src 'self';  style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none';");  

and it worked without problems. The script wasn't injected anymore.


My first social media web application

Mozilla doesnt allow some csp attributes and in order to get the protection through the csp i had to rewrite the template files.
At first the signin and signup button scripts/buttons were blocked so i outsourced every inline function so this eventhandler worked but inserted xss wouldnt.
In order to protect my form I also only allowed to send them to the "./squeak" address.

I used the following CSP for the social media web application:
res.setHeader(
        'Report-To',
        '{"group":"csp-endpoint","max_age":10886400,"endpoints":[{"url":"https://localhost:8000/report"}],"include_subdomains":true}'
    );

res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy", "default-src 'self' ; script-src 'self' ;  style-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action https://localhost:8000/;report-uri https://localhost:8000/report;");

After that I was able to use my application as intenden and XSS Attack were prevented.
